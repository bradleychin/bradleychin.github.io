Hi! My name is Brad and congragulations for making it this far. I made this website to showcase the different kinds of things I learned studying at the Southern Alberta Institute of Alberta (Fast-track Web Development Program).

It was a lot of fun making this site, trying out ideas and the challenging myself. If any of this has intrigued you, please contact me at the email located on the footer. And if you have anymore questions...
